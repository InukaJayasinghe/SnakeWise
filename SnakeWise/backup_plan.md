# 🛡️ Disaster Recovery & Backup Plan

## 🔄 Backup Strategy

- **What gets backed up?**
  - Application files
  - Database (if any)
  - Environment variables

- **Backup Location:**
  - Stored in Google Drive or a secure external storage (could use GitHub repo for static apps)

- **Frequency:**
  - Daily backup of code changes via Git
  - Weekly backup of full project and environment files

## 💥 What If the Site Goes Down?

### Steps to Recover:

1. Pull the latest code from GitHub
2. Re-deploy the project to Vercel (or another platform)
3. Reconfigure any environment variables if needed
4. If you use a database, restore it from the latest backup

## ✅ Tools You Could Use (In a Real-World Case):

- AWS S3 for storage
- GitHub for code history
- Google Drive or OneDrive for manual backups
